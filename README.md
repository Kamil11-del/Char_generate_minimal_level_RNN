# Character-Level Text Generation Using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from Scratch

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a minimal character-level text generation model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built from scratch in Python, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal of this project is to provide an educational example of how RNNs can be used for sequence prediction tasks like text generation.

The model is trained on a text dataset to predict the next character given a sequence of previous characters. After training, it can generate new sequences of text that resemble the style and content of the training data.

## Key Features

- **Vanilla RNN Implementation**: The RNN is implemented from scratch using only NumPy for matrix operations. This provides a deep understanding of how RNNs function under the hood.
- **Character-Level Training**: The model is trained at the character level, meaning that each input and output is a single character, and the network learns to predict the next character in a sequence.
- **Adagrad Optimization**: The model uses the Adagrad optimization algorithm to adapt the learning rate during training.
- **Text Sampling**: A sampling function is provided to generate new sequences of text after the model has been trained.

## Repository Structure

- `rnn_char_generation.py`: The main Python script that contains the RNN model, training loop, and text sampling functions.
- `data/`: This folder should contain the text data used for training. You can place any text file here (e.g., a book or an article).
- `README.md`: This document, explaining the project, how it works, and how to use it.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation

The input data is a text file that is read and converted into a sequence of characters. Each unique character in the text is assigned an index, creating a vocabulary of characters.

### 2. Model Architecture

The model is a simple Vanilla RNN that consists of the following components:

- **Hidden State (`h`)**: A vector that stores the state of the network from the previous time step.
- **Weights (`Wxh`, `Whh`, `Why`)**: Weight matrices that connect the input to the hidden layer, the hidden layer to itself, and the hidden layer to the output layer.
- **Biases (`bh`, `by`)**: Bias terms added to the hidden layer and output layer.
  
At each time step, the model takes an input character (encoded as a one-hot vector), updates the hidden state using the previous hidden state and the current input, and then predicts the next character.

### 3. Loss Function

The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss between the predicted character distribution and the actual next character. The loss is computed over a sequence of characters, and gradients are calculated via backpropagation through time (BPTT).

### 4. Training Loop

The training loop iteratively updates the model parameters using the Adagrad optimization algorithm. At each iteration:

- A sequence of characters is fed into the RNN.
- The model's predictions are compared with the actual next characters to compute the loss.
- Gradients are calculated and used to update the weights and biases.
- The loss and accuracy are tracked over time to monitor the model's performance.

### 5. Text Sampling

After training, the model can generate new text by sampling one character at a time. Given an initial character (the seed), the model predicts the next character, which is fed back into the model to predict the next character, and so on. This process continues for a specified number of characters to generate a new sequence.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rnn-char-generation.git
   cd rnn-char-generation
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Data:**
   
   Place your text file in the `data/` directory. For example, you might use `jungle_book.txt`.

3. **Run the Training Script:**

   ```bash
   python rnn_char_generation.py
   ```

4. **Generate Text:**

   After the model is trained, the script will automatically generate text sequences and display them.

### Sample Output

You can expect the model to produce output like the following after sufficient training:

```
---- 
Once upon a time, in a jungle deep and dense,
There lived a little boy, with a spirit immense.
He wandered through the trees so tall,
With friends from the jungle, one and all.
----
```

## Customization

You can experiment with the following parameters in the script:

- `hidden_size`: The size of the hidden layer.
- `seq_length`: The length of the input sequences.
- `learning_rate`: The learning rate for the Adagrad optimizer.
- `vocab_size`: The size of the character vocabulary (determined by the dataset).

## Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on example of how to implement a simple RNN for character-level text generation. It is a great starting point for understanding the basics of sequence modeling and recurrent neural networks.
